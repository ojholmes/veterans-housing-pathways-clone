# Veterans Housing Pathways — Starter Clone

This repository is a starter scaffold to reproduce the structure and functionality of a veterans housing resource site:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for pages
- Leaflet (OpenStreetMap) for an interactive map

Important: This is a template with placeholder content. Do not copy copyrighted text or proprietary assets without permission.

## Quickstart

1. Install
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the production build
   ```
   npm run preview
   ```

## Deployment
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (both support Vite out of the box).
- Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist`.

## Next steps / customization ideas
- Replace placeholder copy and logos with the site's real content (ensure you have permission).
- Add search & filtering for resources; fetch resources from an API or CSV.
- Add authentication or submission forms backed by a serverless function.
- Improve accessibility and mobile interactions.
- Implement advanced map filtering and clustering for many markers.
